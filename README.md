# dotfiles

My hodge-podge of dotfiles.


## Installation

I haven't built any special script or used [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the installation yet, so for now all you have to do to install a single dotfile is:

    $ ln -s ~/dotfiles/file ~/.file


## Some of my setups

A sample of what this collection of dotfiles looks like on some of the applications I use.

### urxvt

A very simple urxvt setup with a tab bar and the [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-tomorrow-scheme) color scheme.

### Emacs

My text editor/OS of choice with a bunch of plugins, shortcuts, and enhancements.

### Conky

Here I went with a very clean and texty look, using the [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-tomorrow-scheme) color scheme which I absolutely love. This design is so nice that it will blend well with any minimalistic desktop.

### Vim

My previous text editor of choice with a bunch of plugins, all the common configurations to make it saner, tons of new shortcuts, and the classic [Molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) color scheme.
