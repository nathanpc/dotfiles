;;; Commentary:

;; This spot of code extends the `M-x man' interactive spec with
;;    * additional completions of man page names and filenames
;;    * default page name at point which recognises more things
;;    * optional transformation some Perl class names
;; See `man-completion-read' docstring for details.
;;
;; Emacs 23.2 has incorporated some of this, but man-completion.el has more
;; features.

;;; Install:

;; Put man-completion.el in one of your `load-path' directories and the
;; following in your .emacs
;;
;;     (eval-after-load "man" '(require 'man-completion))
;;
;; To use the smart Perl module name at point defaulting, add also
;;
;;     (setq man-completion-at-point-functions
;;           '(man-completion-transform-perl
;;             man-completion-transform-poco))
;;
;; `man-completion-index-files' might depende on man-db system locations,
;; but if wrong it only means changes to manpage names made while Emacs is
;; running are not noticed.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 up and XEmacs 21 up.
;; Probably works in Emacs 20 if you have a replace-regexp-in-string.

;;; Other Ways To Do It:

;; iman.el does similar page name completion, and with info documents too,
;; but not filename completion.  As of iman.el rev 2.22 it includes section
;; number like "cat(1)" but sets "require-match" so if you have cat(1) and
;; catdoc(1) then you must type "cat(" to differentiate.
;;
;; woman.el does a similar completion too, by looking through /usr/share/man
;; etc for a filename, which is also what "bash_completion"
;; (http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org or previously
;; http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion ) does for the bash
;; command line.
;;
;; But the strategy in man-completion.el here is to ask the man program what
;; pages it knows rather than digging in the filesystem.  This helps include
;; aliases man knows from its lexgrog parse if they don't have symlinks (or
;; ".so" pages), and it may also help on strange /etc/manpath.conf setups.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - avoid truncation to tty width on very long page names
;; Version 3 - new page at point transform scheme
;; Version 4 - disallow "[" except for sole "[" alias of "test(1)"
;; Version 5 - cope with non-existent `default-directory'
;; Version 6 - fix perl package name pruning when a section number too
;; Version 7 - notice man-db index file changes to refresh page names
;; Version 8 - page name completion case-insensitive
;; Version 9 - disallow "/" for page name at point
;; Version 10 - disallow dash before hyphen like "X--\nY"
;; Version 11 - add emacs23 `boundaries' in completion
;; Version 12 - :: gets perl page name mangling
;; Version 13 - tie-in to completing-help.el for page descriptions
;; Version 14 - tie-in to icicles.el help, and some bug fixes
;; Version 15 - boundaries at perl "::" separator (emacs23)
;; Version 16 - oops, boundaries wrong, want ":" delim for partial completion
;; Version 17 - complete space after any -X option
;; Version 18 - case-sensitive -l option, remove filename `boundaries'
;; Version 19 - undo defadvice on unload-feature
;; Version 20 - speedup for "[" command at point
;; Version 21 - clean man-completion-at-point-functions on other package unload
;; Version 22 - perl page at point turn foo.pm into foo(3perl) or foo(3pm)
;;            - allow buffer-local man-completion-at-point-functions
;; Version 23 - express dependency on 'advice
;; Version 24 - remove thing-at-point on unload-feature
;; Version 25 - put customize group underneath `man'
;; Version 26 - page name at point exclude perl pod E<gt> and E<lt>
;; Version 27 - fix to recognising constant.pm etc perl-only pages
;; Version 28 - page at point for perl -MFoo::Bar and -MO=Debug
;; Version 29 - fix -k arg and output regexp for MacOS-X man as advised by
;;              Daniel Pittman
;; Version 30 - fix regexp no leading "." on page names
;; Version 31 - page name at point /etc/foo, /usr/bin/foo and L<>
;; Version 32 - page name at point /usr/games/foo
;; Version 33 - further narrowing for speedup in big buffer
;; Version 34 - new email
;; Version 35 - less of 'cl
;; Version 36 - no internal macros after byte compile
;; Version 37 - don't automatically enable by autoload

;;; Code:

;; Previously had autoload cookie here
;;   (eval-after-load "man" '(require 'man-completion))
;; but Emacs 24 up has its own completions so leave it to user preference
;; whether to have that or man-completion.el.  It might have been cute to
;; have per-user M-x package-install enable when installed, but not when
;; system-wide.  Don't think that can be easily arranged.

(require 'man)

;; Explicit dependency on advice.el so it's not unloaded before us.
;; Need `ad-find-advice' macro when running uncompiled, and that macro
;; isn't autoloaded.

* A Perl package name suffix like \"Xyzzy\" expands to say

  ;; In the following `chars' is the permitted characters.  The aim is to make
  ;; this tight to avoid punctuation in text, or operators in program code.
  ;;
  ;;   * The syntax table definition of a word char or symbol char etc is
  ;;     not used, so as to be mode-independent.  It's not unusual to find
  ;;     man page names in comments which are not directly related to the
  ;;     programming language at hand.
  ;;
  ;;   * [:alnum:] includes non-ascii chars, so a word at point with accented
  ;;     chars is taken whole, not just an ascii part of it.  Non-ascii page
  ;;     names will be unlikely, since there's so many ways for it to go wrong
  ;;     between filename coding, file content coding and emacs read coding.
  ;;
  ;;   * [:alnum:] in emacs23 only means word-syntax for non-ascii chars.
  ;;     That's close enough, though the intention is to be
  ;;     mode-independent, including syntax-table independent.
  ;;
  ;;   * [:alnum:] not available in xemacs21, hence the fallback to A-Z etc.
  ;;     What would be better for non-ascii there?
  ;;
  ;;   * "/" is disallowed since believe it doesn't normally occur, and
  ;;     disallowing it gets the the right page name from a perl POD
  ;;     L<pagename/section>.  The way man uses directories to hold pages will
  ;;     mean there can't be a "/" in the primary page name, though it might
  ;;     conceivably be in an alias lexgrog could pick out from the NAME part.
  ;;
  ;; `word' is setup so
  ;;
  ;;   * "." and "-" are allowed in the middle of a page name, but not as
  ;;     the first or last char.  Disallowing a final dot helps a page name
  ;;     at the end of a sentence.
  ;;
  ;;   * "-" is not allowed before a hyphen sequence "-\n", so "foo--\nbar"
  ;;     is not considered a hyphenation.  This helps when the dashes on the
  ;;     previous line are a separator like a "--cut-here--".  groff doesn't
  ;;     hyphenate after a dash, unless you explicitly give it permission
  ;;     with \%, so a double dash shouldn't normally occur.
  ;;

  ;;     special case in `man-completion-at-point' for "[" alone, the shell
  ;;     "test" command.

  ;;   * [:digit:] digits are allowed at the start of a page name.  This is

  ;;     loosened (which would simplify the regexp too).  A ":" at the end
  ;;     is disallowed though, since that'd most often be punctuation.
  ;;
  ;;   * A "::" is deliberately not matched at the end, for the benefit of
  ;;     perl code using the double-colon bareword Glib::Object:: etc for a
  ;;     class name.  In that case just Glib::Object is the page name.
  ;;
  ;;   * A section suffix like "chmod(2)" is matched only as a digit "(2)"
  ;;     or digit and alnums like "(3X)" or "(3ncurses)".  The match is kept
  ;;     tight so that on program code like "exit(errors ? 0 : 1)" it won't
  ;;     get the arg in parens, just the "exit".  Clearly this can be
  ;;     tricked by say "exit(1)" as code, but a space is not matched so GNU
  ;;     style "exit (1)" is ok.  It's expected that in comments or a
  ;;     document you won't put a space before a section number.

For a plain page like \"cat\" there's two entries, the plain name

  "Read the name of a man page.
A man page name at point is offered as a default, and completions
come from the pages reported by \"man -k\" (its \"apropos\"
database).

A explicit filename can be entered as any of the following, with
filename completion.

    ./foo
    /some/dir/foo
    -l foo

An \"apropos\" query can be entered as per the \"man\" command
line.

    -k foo

This \"-k\" is a normal feature of `M-x man', but not well
documented.  Prior to Emacs 23.2 if there's no matches then the
error is \"Can't find the -k foo manpage\", which might make you
think it tried to get a page called \"-k\", but it just means
nothing matching \"foo\".

Special cases for the default name at point are

    /usr/bin/foo    program names with full paths
    /etc/foo        config files
    L<foo>          Perl POD link markup
    -MFoo::Bar      Perl command line Foo::Bar
    -MO=Concise     Perl command line B::Concise module

The paths /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/games and /etc work with point
anywhere in those names not just on the final \"foo\".  They're
good for full paths in shell scripts and similar.  The L<> markup
works with point anywhere in that form too.  The -M form strips
the \"M\" from the module name, and -MO= becomes \"B::\".

Page name completion is case-insensitive because \"man\" is
case-insensitive and because it helps odd combinations of
upper/lower in page names.  Filename case sensitivity follows
`read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' the same as
`read-file-name'.

If the default page name offered is not quite right remember
the usual `\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]' puts it in the minibuffer to edit.

If `completing-help-mode' (completing-help.el) is enabled then
page descriptions are shown in the completions list with `\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[minibuffer-completion-help]' etc.

If `icicle-mode' is enabled then page descriptions and filename
descriptions are available with the usual icicles help.
